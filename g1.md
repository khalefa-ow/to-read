# Research Paper Summaries

## 1. Text-Augmented Open Knowledge Graph Completion via Pre-Trained Language Models
- **Title**: Text-Augmented Open Knowledge Graph Completion via Pre-Trained Language Models
- **Summary**: This paper proposes TAGREAL, a new framework for open knowledge graph (KG) completion that utilizes pre-trained language models (PLMs) to draw new findings from known facts. TAGREAL automatically generates query prompts and retrieves support information from large text corpora to probe knowledge from PLMs for KG completion. Experiments show that TAGREAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets, even with limited training data, outperforming existing methods.

## 2. CMDL: Cross Modal Data Discovery over Structured and Unstructured Data Lakes
- **Title**: CMDL: Cross Modal Data Discovery over Structured and Unstructured Data Lakes
- **Summary**: This paper introduces CMDL, a novel data discovery system that addresses the limitations of existing data discovery solutions by supporting data discovery tasks over both structured and unstructured data while retaining the structural properties of tables. CMDL introduces a multi-modal embedding representation to capture similarities between text documents and tabular columns. It utilizes various signatures and sketches on both data content and metadata to support diverse data discovery questions.

## 3. On the Reasonable Effectiveness of Relational Diagrams
- **Title**: On the Reasonable Effectiveness of Relational Diagrams
- **Summary**: This paper presents a study on the effectiveness of Relational Diagrams as a visual language for expressing relational queries. Through a user study with 102 participants, the authors evaluate the understandability and usability of Relational Diagrams compared to other query languages like SQL and relational algebra. The results show that Relational Diagrams are significantly more understandable and usable for a variety of query tasks.

## 4. Spatial-Structure Prompting for Vision and Language Models
- **Title**: Spatial-Structure Prompting for Vision and Language Models
- **Summary**: This paper proposes a method for synthesizing millions of spatial questions and answers from internet-scale images to improve the spatial reasoning abilities of vision and language models. This data synthesis pipeline leverages CLIP for filtering noisy images, expert models for object segmentation and depth estimation, and shape analysis rules for extracting object properties.

## 8. RetClean: Retrieval-Based Data Cleaning Using LLMs and Data Lakes
- **Title**: RetClean: Retrieval-Based Data Cleaning Using LLMs and Data Lakes
- **Summary**: This paper introduces RetClean, a system that leverages large language models (LLMs) and data lakes for data cleaning. RetClean supports three scenarios: using public LLMs for non-private data, using RAG with a data lake for local enterprise data, and using locally hosted small LLMs for privacy-sensitive data.
